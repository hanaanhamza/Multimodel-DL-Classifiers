# Multimodel Deep Learning Classifiers
This repository contains a collection of deep learning models implemented for various classification tasks using different neural network architectures. It showcases how multimodal neural networks can be applied to structured data, image data, and text data for effective classification.

## Project Summaries

### ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
- **Models Used**: 
  - Perceptron (from scratch)
  - DNN (using deep learning frameworks)
  - Backpropagation-based NN (manual implementation)
- **Goal**: Predict the species of iris flowers based on sepal/petal measurements.

### ðŸ§  Image Classification & Tumor Detection
- **Models Used**: CNN
- **Datasets**:
  - **MNIST**: Handwritten digit recognition.
  - **Tumor Detection**: Classification of medical images (e.g., brain tumor presence).
- **Goal**: Apply CNNs to structured pixel data for image classification tasks.

### ðŸ“© SMS Spam Classification
- **Model Used**: RNN
- **Dataset**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Goal**: Classify messages as spam or not spam by modeling sequences of text.
